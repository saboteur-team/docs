# Versions

For PC, there is several versions of game (executable) available:

- Retail Release - v1.0.0.1 - contains SecuROM DRM
- Skidrow Crack for Retail Release - v1.0.0.1 - removes SecuROM DRM from the Retail executable and also extracts some files which are bundled into the .exe
- Origin Version - ???
- GOG Version - This version is interesting, because it's Retail Release version, with Skidrow crack, and with binary patch (who someone post into the reviews on GOG) to support 4+ core CPUs. So basically this release is using cracked exe. This also means that offsets for GOG Version are same as for Skidrow crack.
